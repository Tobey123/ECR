Execute Collect Report -  a tool for remote code execution and reporting

### Work in Progress

The idea is to have a set of small tools for:

* preparing jobs or *tasks*
* sending them to remote machines
* executing them there 
* and reporting results back

The underlying tech is based on [Ã˜MQ](http://zeromq.org/), [Redis](https://redis.io/) and [cJSON](https://github.com/DaveGamble/cJSON).
